# Room for improvement
This document is part two of [this repo's design documentation](../README.md)
that aims to determine what challenges an advanced elm package search might
have to tackle. 

In [part one](01-status-quo.md) we examined what the current user experience is
when searching on [package.elm-lang.org](package.elm-lang.org) and how it compares
to a normal search engine in the wild. We've seen a breakdown of the categories
of users we might encounter and what they might be looking for on the Elm package
site.

In this part we're going to have a look at how other web frameworks are dealing 
with discoverability of their APIs and packages. 

# Honorable Mention
The [Dojo Toolkit](https://dojotoolkit.org/documentation/) has a lot of 
documentation but it provides no dynamic discoverability.

# Case study
We now take a look at some examples of the documentation and package registries
that is available for well known frameworks/libraries:

* [Angular](https://angular.io/docs)
* [Aurelia](http://aurelia.io/hub.html)
* [Ember](https://www.emberjs.com/learn/)
* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html)
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
