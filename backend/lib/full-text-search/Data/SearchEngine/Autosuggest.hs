-- | Execute an \"auto-suggest\" query. This is where one of the search terms
-- is an incomplete prefix and we are looking for possible completions of that
-- search term, and result documents to go with the possible completions.
--
-- An auto-suggest query only gives useful results when the 'SearchEngine' is
-- configured to use a non-term feature score. That is, when we can give
-- documents an importance score independent of what terms we are looking for.
-- This is because an auto-suggest query is backwards from a normal query: we
-- are asking for relevant terms occurring in important or popular documents
-- so we need some notion of important or popular. Without this we would just
-- be ranking based on term frequency which while it makes sense for normal
-- \"forward\" queries is pretty meaningless for auto-suggest \"reverse\"
-- queries. Indeed for single-term auto-suggest queries the ranking function
-- we use will assign 0 for all documents and completions if there is no 
-- non-term feature scores.

--
--   To process the query means to compute the subset T' ⊆ T of terms that

--
--   The obvious way to use an inverted index to process an autocompletion
--   query (T, D) is to compute, for each t ∈ T, the intersections D ∩ Dt.
--   Then, T' is simply the set of all t for which the intersection was

-- Scoring
-------------
--
-- From Bast and Weber:
--   In practice, only a selection of items from these lists can and will be
--   presented to the user, and it is of course crucial that the most relevant
--   completions and hits are selected.
--
--   A standard approach for this task in ad-hoc retrieval is to have a
--   precomputed score for each term-in-document pair, and when a query is
--   being processed, to aggregate these scores for each candidate document,
--   and return documents with the highest such aggregated scores.
--
--   Both INV and HYB can be easily adapted to implement any such scoring and
--   aggregation scheme: store by each term-in-document pair its precomputed
--   score, and when intersecting, aggregate the scores. A decision has to be
--   made on how to reconcile scores from different completions within the
--   same document. We suggest the following: when merging the intersections
--   (which gives the set D' according to Definition 1), compute for each
--   document in D' the maximal score achieved for some completion in T'
--   contained in that document, and compute for each completion in T' the
--   maximal score achieved for a hit from D' achieved for this completion.
--
-- So firstly let us explore what this means and then discuss why it does not
-- work for BM25.
--
-- The "precomputed score for each term-in-document pair" refers to the bm25
-- score for this term in this document (and obviously doesn't have to be
-- precomputed, though that'd be faster).
--
-- So the score for a document d ∈ D' is:
--   maximum of score for d ∈ D ∩ Dt, for any t ∈ T'
--
-- While the score for a completion t ∈ T' is:
--   maximum of score for d ∈ D ∩ Dt
--
-- So for documents we say their score is their best score for any of the
-- completion terms they contain. While for completions we say their score
-- is their best score for any of the documents they appear in.
--
-- For a scoring function like BM25 this appears to be not a good method, both
-- in principle and in practice. Consider what terms get high BM25 scores:
-- very rare ones. So this means we're going to score highly documents that
-- contain the least frequent terms, and completions that are themselves very
-- rare. This is silly.
--
-- Another important thing to note is that if we use this scoring method then
-- we are using the BM25 score in a way that makes no sense. The BM25 score
-- for different documents for the /same/ set of terms are comparable. The
-- score for the same for different document with different terms are simply
-- not comparable.
--
-- This also makes sense if you consider what question the BM25 score is
-- answering: "what is the likelihood that this document is relevant given that
-- I judge these terms to be relevant". However an auto-suggest query is
-- different: "what is the likelihood that this term is relevant given the
-- importance/popularity of the documents (and any preceding terms I've judged
-- to be relevant)". They are both conditional likelihood questions but with
-- different premises.
--
-- More generally, term frequency information simply isn't useful for
-- auto-suggest queries. We don't want results that have the most obscure terms
-- nor the most common terms, not even something in-between. Term frequency
-- just doesn't tell us anything unless we've already judged terms to be
-- relevant, and in an auto-suggest query we've not done that yet.
--
-- What we really need is information on the importance/popularity of the
-- documents. We can actually do something with that.
--
-- So, instead we follow a different strategy. We require that we have
-- importance/popularity info for the documents.
--
-- A first approximation would be to rank result documents by their importance
-- and completion terms by the sum of the importance of the documents each
-- term appears in.
--
-- Score for a document d ∈ D'
--   importance score for d
--
-- Score for a completion t ∈ T'
--   sum of importance score for d ∈ D ∩ Dt
--
-- The only problem with this is that just because a term appears in an
-- important document, doesn't mean that term is /about/ that document, or to
-- put it another way, that term may not be relevant for that document. For
-- example common words like "the" likely appear in all important documents
-- but this doesn't really tell us anything because "the" isn't an important
-- keyword.
--
-- So what we want to do is to weight the document importance by the relevance
-- of the keyword to the document. So now if we have an important document and
-- a relevant keyword for that document then we get a high score, but an
-- irrelevant term like "the" would get a very low weighting and so would not
-- contribute much to the score, even for very important documents.
--
-- The intuition is that we will score term completions by taking the
-- document importance weighted by the relevance of that term to that document
-- and summing over all the documents where the term occurs.
--
-- We define document importance (for the set D') to be the BM25F score for
-- the documents with any preceding terms. So this includes the non-term
-- feature score for the importance/popularity, and also takes account of
-- preceding terms if there were any.
--
-- We define term relevance (for terms in documents) to be the BM25F score for
-- that term in that document as a fraction of the total BM25F score for all
-- terms in the document. Thus the relevance of all terms in a document sums
-- to 1.
--
-- Now we can re-weight the document importance by the term relevance:
--
-- Score for a completion t ∈ T'
--   sum (for d ∈ D ∩ Dt) of ( importance for d * relevance for t in d )
--
-- And now for document result scores. We don't want to just stick with the
-- innate document importance. We want to re-weight by the completion term
-- scores:
--
-- Score for a document d ∈ D'
--   sum (for t ∈ T' ∩ d) (importance score for d * score for completion t)
--
-- Clear as mud?

-- | Precompute the document importance and the term relevance breakdown for
-- all the documents. This will be used in scoring the term completions
-- and the result documents. They will all be used and some used many
-- times so it's better to compute up-front and share.
--
-- This is actually the expensive bit (which is why we've filtered already).
